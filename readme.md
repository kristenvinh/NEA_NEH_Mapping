Created by Kristen Vinh -- I wanted a quick mapping project to quickly identify NEA and NEH grants as federal representatives once again threatened to reduce NEA and NEH Funding.

Notes: This project isn't associated with Americans for the Arts or any other organization. Addresses and districts were looked up by first using Google's Geocode API based on zip codes (which may not be 100% accurate) and matching those to Congressional Districts.

### Americans for the Arts Advocacy Action

The FYâ€™25 House Interior Appropriations bill is going to the House floor for consideration the week of July 22, 2024. This bill currently appropriates $203.895 million each to the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). While this represents a 1.5 percent cut below current funding levels, two drastic amendments will be offered on the House floor next week by freshman Freedom Caucus member Rep. Josh Brecheen (R-OK), which would further cut NEA and NEH by an additional $48 million each. 

TAKE ACTION by going to the Arts Action Center and sending a pre-written, customizable message to your U.S. House Member by July 22nd, urging them to VOTE NO on the Brecheen FY'25 Interior Appropriations amendments: www.artsactionfund.org/arts-action-center.
